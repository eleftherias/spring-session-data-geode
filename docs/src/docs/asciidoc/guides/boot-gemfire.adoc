This guide describes how to build a Spring Boot application configured with Spring Session to transparently leverage
Apache Geode to manage a web application's `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession`.

In this sample, Apache Geode's client/server topology is employed using a pair of Spring Boot applications, one to
configure and run a Apache Geode Server and another to configure and run the cache client, Spring MVC-based web application
making use of the `HttpSession`.

NOTE: The completed guide can be found in the

== Updating Dependencies

Before using Spring Session, you must ensure that the required dependencies are included.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `dependencies` in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependencies>
	<!-- ... -->

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-session-data-geode</artifactId>
		<version>{spring-session-data-geode-version}</version>
		<type>pom</type>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

ifeval::["{version-snapshot}" == "true"]
Since we are using a SNAPSHOT version, we need to add the Spring Snapshot Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-snapshot</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{version-milestone}" == "true"]
Since we are using a Milestone version, we need to add the Spring Milestone Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-milestone</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
endif::[]

== Spring Boot Configuration

After adding the required dependencies and repository declarations, we can create the Spring configuration
for both our Apache Geode client and server using Spring Boot.  The Spring configuration is responsible for creating
a Servlet `Filter` that replaces the `HttpSession` with an implementation backed by Spring Session and Apace Geode.

=== Spring Boot, Apache Geode Cache Server

We start with a Spring Boot application to configure and bootstrap the Apache Geode Server:

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/gemfire/src/main/java/sample/server/GemFireServer.java[tags=class]
----

<1> First, we annotate the Apache Geode Server configuration class (`GemFireServer`) with `@SpringBootApplication`
to indicate that this is a Spring Boot application leveraging all of _Spring Boot's_ features
(e.g. _auto-configuration_).
<2> Next, we use the Spring Data for Apache Geode configuration annotation `@CacheServerApplication` to simplify
the creation of a peer cache instance containing a `CacheServer` for cache clients to connect.
<3> (Optional) Then, the `@EnableGemFireHttpSession` annotation is used to create the necessary server-side `Region`
(by default, "_ClusteredSpringSessions_") to store the `HttpSessions` state.  This step is optional since the
Session `Region` could be created manually, perhaps even using external means.  Using `@EnableGemFireHttpSession`
is convenient and quick.

=== Spring Boot, Apache Geode Cache Client Web application

Now, we create a Spring Boot Web application to expose our Web service with Spring Web MVC, running as an Apache Geode
cache client connected to our Spring Boot, Apache Geode Server.  The Web application will use Spring Session
backed by Apache Geode to manage `HttpSession` state in a clustered (distributed) and replicated manner.

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/gemfire/src/main/java/sample/client/Application.java[tags=class]
----

<1> Again, we declare our Web application to be a Spring Boot application by annotating our application class
with `@SpringBootApplication`.
<2> `@Controller` is a Spring Web MVC annotation enabling our MVC handler mapping methods (i.e. methods annotated
with `@RequestMapping`) to process HTTP requests (e.g. <7>)
<3> We also declare our Web application to be an Apache Geode cache client by annotating our application class with
`@ClientCacheApplication`.  Additionally, we adjust a few basic, "DEFAULT" `Pool` settings (e.g. `readTimeout`).
<4> Next, we declare that the Web application will use Spring Session backed by Apache Geode by annotating the
`ClientCacheConfiguration` class with `@EnableGemFireHttpSession`.  This will create the necessary client-side `Region`
(by default, "ClusteredSpringSessions` as a `PROXY` `Region`) corresponding to the same server-side `Region`
by name. All `HttpSession` state will be sent from the cache client Web application to the server through `Region`
data access operations.  The client-side `Region` uses the "DEFAULT" `Pool`.
<5> Then, we wait to ensure the Apache Geode Server is up and running before we proceed.  This is only really useful
for automated (integration) testing purposes.
<6> We adjust the Spring Web MVC configuration to set the home page, and...
<7> Finally, we declare the `/sessions` HTTP request handler method to set an HTTP Session attribute
and increment a count for the number of HTTP requests.

There are many other useful utility methods, so please refer to the actual source code for full details.

TIP: In typical Apache Geode production deployments, where the cluster includes potentially hundreds or thousands
of servers (a.k.a. data nodes), it is more common for clients to connect to 1 or more Apache Geode Locators running
in the same cluster. A Locator passes meta-data to clients about the servers available in the cluster, the individual
server load and which servers have the client's data of interest, which is particularly important for direct,
single-hop data access and latency-sensitive applications.  See more details about the
{data-store-docs}/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/standard_client_server_deployment.html[Client/Server Deployment]
in the Apache Geode User Guide.

NOTE: For more information on configuring Spring Data Geode, refer to the {sdg-docs}[Reference Guide].

The `@EnableGemFireHttpSession` annotation enables developers to configure certain aspects of both Spring Session
and Apache Geode out-of-the-box using the following attributes:

* `clientRegionShortcut` - specifies Apache Geode {data-store-docs}/developing/region_options/region_types.html[data management policy]
on the client with the {data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/client/ClientRegionShortcut.html[ClientRegionShortcut]
(default is `PROXY`).  This attribute is only used when configuring the client `Region`.
* `indexableSessionAttributes` - Identifies the Session attributes by name that should be indexed for querying purposes.
Only Session attributes explicitly identified by name will be indexed.
* `maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds` - controls _HttpSession_ idle-timeout expiration (defaults to **30 minutes**).
* `poolName` - name of the dedicated Apache Geode `Pool` used to connect a client to the cluster of servers.
This attribute is only used when the application is a cache client.  Defaults to `gemfirePool`.
* `regionName` - specifies the name of the Apache Geode `Region` used to store and manage `HttpSession` state
(default is "*ClusteredSpringSessions*").
* `serverRegionShortcut` - specifies Apache Geode {data-store-docs}/developing/region_options/region_types.html[data management policy]
on the server with the {data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/RegionShortcut.html[RegionShortcut]
(default is `PARTITION`).  This attribute is only used when configuring server `Regions`,
or when a P2P topology is employed.

NOTE: It is important to remember that the Apache Geode client `Region` name must match a server `Region`
by the same name if the client `Region` is a `PROXY` or `CACHING_PROXY`.  Client and server `Region` names
are not required to match if the client `Region` used to store session state is `LOCAL`.  However, keep in mind
that Session state will not be propagated to the server and you lose all the benefits of using Apache Geode
to store and manage distributed, replicated session state information on the servers in a distributed,
replicated manner.

== Spring Boot Sample Web Application with an Apache Geode managed HttpSession

=== Running the Boot Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following commands.

First, you must run the server:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-boot-gemfire:run
----

Then, in a separate terminal, run the client:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-boot-gemfire:bootRun
----

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/.

In this sample, the Web application is the Spring Boot, Apache Geode cache client
and the server is standalone, separate (JVM) process.

=== Exploring the Boot Sample Application

Try using the application. Fill out the form with the following information:

* **Attribute Name:** _username_
* **Attribute Value:** _test_

Now click the **Set Attribute** button. You should now see the attribute name and value displayed in the table
along with an additional attribute (`requestCount`) indicating the number of Session interactions (via HTTP requests).

=== How does it work?

We interact with the standard `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` in the the Spring Web MVC service endpoint,
shown here for convenience:

.src/main/java/sample/client/Application.java
[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST, path = "/session")
public String session(HttpSession session, ModelMap modelMap,
		@RequestParam(name = "attributeName", required = false) String name,
		@RequestParam(name = "attributeValue", required = false) String value) {

	modelMap.addAttribute("sessionAttributes",
		attributes(setAttribute(updateRequestCount(session), name, value)));

	return INDEX_TEMPLATE_VIEW_NAME;
}
----

Instead of using the embedded HTTP server's `HttpSession`, we are actually persisting the Session state in Apache Geode.
Spring Session creates a cookie named SESSION in your browser that contains the id of your Session.
