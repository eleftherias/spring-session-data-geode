This guide describes how to configure Spring Session to transparently leverage Apache Geode to manage
a Web application's `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` using Java Configuration.

== Updating Dependencies

Before using Spring Session, you must ensure that the required dependencies are included.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `dependencies` in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependencies>
	<!-- ... -->

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-session-data-geode</artifactId>
		<version>{spring-session-data-geode-version}</version>
		<type>pom</type>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>
		<version>{spring-version}</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

ifeval::["{version-snapshot}" == "true"]
Since we are using a SNAPSHOT version, we need to add the Spring Snapshot Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-snapshot</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{version-milestone}" == "true"]
Since we are using a Milestone version, we need to add the Spring Milestone Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-milestone</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
endif::[]

== Spring Java Configuration

After adding the required dependencies and repository declarations, we can create the Spring configuration.
The Spring configuration is responsible for creating a Servlet `Filter` that replaces the `HttpSession`
with an implementation backed by Spring Session and Apache Geode.

=== Client Configuration

Add the following Spring configuration:

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}javaconfig/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/java/sample/client/ClientConfig.java[tags=class]
----

<1> First, we declare our Web application to be an Apache Geode cache client by annotating our `ClientConfig` class
with `@ClientCacheApplication`.  Additionally, we adjust a few basic, "DEFAULT" `Pool` settings (e.g. `readTimeout`).
<2> `@EnableGemFireHttpSession` creates a Spring bean named `springSessionRepositoryFilter` that implements
`javax.servlet.Filter`. The filter replaces the `HttpSession` with an implementation provided by Spring Session
and backed by Apache Geode. Additionally, the configuration will also create the necessary client-side `Region`
(by default, "ClusteredSpringSessions`, which is a `PROXY` `Region`) corresponding to the same server-side `Region`
by name. All session state is sent from the client to the server through `Region` data access operations.
The client-side `Region` use the "DEFAULT" `Pool`.
<3> Then, we wait to ensure the Apache Geode Server is up and running before we proceed.  This is only really useful
for automated (integration) testing purposes.

TIP: In typical Apache Geode production deployments, where the cluster includes potentially hundreds or thousands
of servers (a.k.a. data nodes), it is more common for clients to connect to 1 or more Apache Geode Locators running
in the same cluster. A Locator passes meta-data to clients about the servers available in the cluster, the individual
server load and which servers have the client's data of interest, which is particularly important for direct,
single-hop data access and latency-sensitive applications.  See more details about the
{data-store-docs}/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/standard_client_server_deployment.html[Client/Server Deployment]
in the Apache Geode User Guide.

NOTE: For more information on configuring Spring Data Geode, refer to the {sdg-docs}[Reference Guide].

The `@EnableGemFireHttpSession` annotation enables developers to configure certain aspects of both Spring Session
and Apache Geode out-of-the-box using the following attributes:

* `clientRegionShortcut` - specifies Apache Geode {data-store-docs}/developing/region_options/region_types.html[data management policy]
on the client with the {data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/client/ClientRegionShortcut.html[ClientRegionShortcut]
(default is `PROXY`).  This attribute is only used when configuring the client `Region`.
* `indexableSessionAttributes` - Identifies the Session attributes by name that should be indexed for querying purposes.
Only Session attributes explicitly identified by name will be indexed.
* `maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds` - controls _HttpSession_ idle-timeout expiration (defaults to **30 minutes**).
* `poolName` - name of the dedicated Apache Geode `Pool` used to connect a client to the cluster of servers.
This attribute is only used when the application is a cache client.  Defaults to `gemfirePool`.
* `regionName` - specifies the name of the Apache Geode `Region` used to store and manage `HttpSession` state
(default is "*ClusteredSpringSessions*").
* `serverRegionShortcut` - specifies Apache Geode {data-store-docs}/developing/region_options/region_types.html[data management policy]
on the server with the {data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/RegionShortcut.html[RegionShortcut]
(default is `PARTITION`).  This attribute is only used when configuring server `Regions`,
or when a P2P topology is employed.

NOTE: It is important to remember that the Apache Geode client `Region` name must match a server `Region`
by the same name if the client `Region` is a `PROXY` or `CACHING_PROXY`.  Client and server `Region` names
are not required to match if the client `Region` used to store session state is `LOCAL`.  However, keep in mind
that Session state will not be propagated to the server and you lose all the benefits of using Apache Geode
to store and manage distributed, replicated session state information on the servers in a distributed,
replicated manner.

=== Server Configuration

So far, we only covered one side of the equation.  We also need an Apache Geode Server for our cache client to talk to
and send session state to the server to manage.

In this sample, we will use the following Java configuration to configure and run an Apache Geode Server:

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}javaconfig/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/java/sample/server/GemFireServer.java[tags=class]
----

<1> First, we use the `@CacheServerApplication` annotation to simplify the creation of a peer cache instance
containing with a `CacheServer` for cache clients to connect.
<2> (Optional) Then, the `GemFireServer` class is annotated with `@EnableGemFireHttpSession` to create the necessary
server-side `Region` (by default, "_ClusteredSpringSessions_") used to store `HttpSession` state.  This step is
optional since the Session `Region` could be created manually, perhaps using external means.
Using `@EnableGemFireHttpSession` is convenient and quick.

== Java Servlet Container Initialization

Our <<httpsession-spring-java-configuration,Spring Java Configuration>> created a Spring bean named `springSessionRepositoryFilter`
that implements `javax.servlet.Filter`. The `springSessionRepositoryFilter` bean is responsible for replacing the
`javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` with a custom implementation backed by Spring Session and Apache Geode.

In order for our `Filter` to do its magic, Spring needs to load the `ClientConfig` class. We also need to ensure our
Servlet container (i.e. Tomcat) uses our `springSessionRepositoryFilter` for every request.

Fortunately, Spring Session provides a utility class named `AbstractHttpSessionApplicationInitializer` to make both
steps extremely easy.

You can find an example below:

.src/main/java/sample/Initializer.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}javaconfig/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/java/sample/client/Initializer.java[tags=class]
----

NOTE: The name of our class (`Initializer`) does not matter. What is important is that we extend
`AbstractHttpSessionApplicationInitializer`.

<1> The first step is to extend `AbstractHttpSessionApplicationInitializer`. This ensures that a Spring bean named
`springSessionRepositoryFilter` is registered with our Servlet container and used on every HTTP request.
<2> `AbstractHttpSessionApplicationInitializer` also provides a mechanism to easily allow Spring to load
our `ClientConfig`.

== HttpSession managed by a Java configured, Apache Geode Client/Server Sample Application

=== Running the Apache Geode Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following commands.

First, you need to run the server using:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-javaconfig-gemfire-clientserver:run
----

Then, in a separate terminal, run the client using:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-javaconfig-gemfire-clientserver:tomcatRun
----

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/.

In this sample, the web application is the Apache Geode cache client and the server is standalone, separate JVM process.

=== Exploring the httpsession-gemfire-clientserver Sample Application

Try using the application. Fill out the form with the following information:

* **Attribute Name:** _username_
* **Attribute Value:** _john_

Now click the **Set Attribute** button. You should now see the attribute name and value displayed in the table.

=== How does it work?

We interact with the standard `HttpSession` in the `SessionServlet` shown below:

.src/main/java/sample/SessionServlet.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}javaconfig/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/java/sample/client/SessionServlet.java[tags=class]
----

Instead of using Tomcat's `HttpSession`, we are actually persisting the Session in Apache Geode.

Spring Session creates a cookie named SESSION in your browser that contains the id of your Session.
